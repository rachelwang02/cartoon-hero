            <h2>About Peppa</h2>
            <p>Peppa Pig is a lovable but slightly bossy little pig. She is four years old and lives with Mummy Pig, 
                Daddy Pig and her little brother George. Peppa likes playing with her best friend Suzy Sheep, 
                visiting Granny and Grandpa Pig and looking after George. Most of all, Peppa loves jumping up and 
                down in muddy puddles, laughing and making loud snorting noises.</p>
